# 🛒 SCT_ML_2: Mall Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

## Task Objective
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on simulated purchase history data (Annual Income and Spending Score).

## File Contents
- **Task_02_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, simulated data, model training, and segmentation results.
- **clusters_plot.png** (Optional): Visualization of the final segmented clusters.

## 📊 Clustering Methodology and Results

### Segmentation Details
1.  **Algorithm:** K-Means Clustering (`k-means++` initialization).
2.  **Features Used:** Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).
3.  **Optimal K:** Based on the Elbow Method analysis (performed within the notebook), **K=5** was chosen to define the distinct customer segments.
